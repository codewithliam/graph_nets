I have worked with this library in research and developement, because my work was proprietary, I cannot upload code. 

Information about the libraries can be found here: 

[Graph Nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets): Google Deepminds Graph Neural Network framework

[Deep Graph Library (DGL)](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl) Community sourced Graph learning library
